# 🚀 AI-Driven Adaptive Diagnostic Engine

An AI-powered backend system that dynamically evaluates a student's ability level through **adaptive testing** and generates a **personalized study plan**.

Unlike traditional static exams, this system adjusts the difficulty of each question based on the user's previous responses, enabling a more accurate assessment of their proficiency.

The project demonstrates the core architecture used in **adaptive learning platforms like GRE, GMAT, and modern EdTech systems**.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

The **AI-Driven Adaptive Diagnostic Engine** is designed to make assessments smarter by dynamically selecting questions based on a student’s ability level.

The system works by:

1. Starting with a baseline ability score
2. Dynamically selecting questions based on ability
3. Updating the ability score after each answer
4. Generating an **AI-powered personalized study plan** at the end of the test

This enables a **short but highly informative diagnostic test**.

# 🖥 Demo

Once the server is running, open the Swagger interface:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

This interactive interface allows you to test the adaptive engine.

---

## Example Workflow

### 1️⃣ Start a Session

```
POST /session/start-session
```

Response:

```json
{
 "session_id": "uuid-session-id"
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Fetch Next Adaptive Question

```
GET /question/next/{session_id}
```

The system selects the question whose difficulty is closest to the user's ability.

Example response:

```json
{
 "question_id": "64bc01f8e13d9abcde123456",
 "question": "What are the solutions to x^2 - 16 = 0?",
 "options": ["4","-4","4 and -4","16"],
 "difficulty": 0.5
}
```

---

### 3️⃣ Submit an Answer

```
POST /question/submit-answer
```

Example request:

```json
{
 "session_id": "session-id",
 "question_id": "question-id",
 "answer": "4 and -4"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
 "correct": true,
 "updated_ability": 0.55
}
```

---

### 4️⃣ Adaptive Difficulty Adjustment

After each answer:

* ability score updates
* next question difficulty adapts

---

### 5️⃣ Generate AI Study Plan

After the test completes:

```
GET /session/study-plan/{session_id}
```

Example response:

```json
{
 "study_plan": [
  "Review Algebra fundamentals",
  "Practice medium difficulty GRE questions",
  "Take timed quizzes to improve speed"
 ]
}
```
---

# 🏗 System Architecture

The project follows a **modular backend architecture**.

```
Client (Swagger UI / API Consumer)
        ↓

# 🧠 Adaptive Algorithm Logic

The engine implements a simplified **1-Dimensional Item Response Theory (IRT)** model.

---

## Step 1 — Session Initialization

Every session begins with:

```
ability_score = 0.5
```

This represents a **medium difficulty baseline**.

---

## Step 2 — Adaptive Question Selection

The system selects the question whose difficulty is closest to the user’s ability.

```
| difficulty − ability | → minimum
```

Example:

| Ability | Question Difficulty |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 0.5     | 0.5                 |
| 0.6     | 0.6                 |
| 0.7     | 0.7                 |

---

## Step 3 — Ability Score Update

Probability of correct answer:

```
P(correct) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(ability − difficulty)))
```

Ability update:

```
ability_new = ability + learning_rate * (actual − P(correct))
```

Where

```
learning_rate = 0.1
actual = 1 if correct
actual = 0 if incorrect
```

---

## Step 4 — Test Completion

The test stops automatically after:

```
10 questions
```

# 🤖 AI Log

AI tools such as **Cursor AI** and **ChatGPT** were used during development to accelerate engineering tasks.

### AI was used for:

* generating FastAPI project structure
* writing MongoDB utilities
* designing Pydantic models
* implementing adaptive algorithm
* generating GRE question dataset
* integrating OpenAI API
* improving error handling

---

### Challenges AI Could Not Fully Solve

Some aspects required manual debugging:

* session state management in MongoDB
* preventing repeated questions
* tuning ability score updates
* handling OpenAI API quota errors
* ensuring clean service architecture

AI accelerated development but final integration required manual reasoning.
